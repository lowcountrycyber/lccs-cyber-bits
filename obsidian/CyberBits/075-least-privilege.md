# Least Privilege

**One-liner:** Least privilege means users get only the access they need and no more.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Limiting access shrinks the damage a stolen account can cause.

**Related:** [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](076-role-based-access-control), [Admin Account](077-admin-account), [Zero Trust](013-zero-trust)
