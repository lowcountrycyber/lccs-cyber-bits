# Least Privilege

**One-liner:** Least privilege means users get only the access they need and no more.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Limiting access shrinks the damage a stolen account can cause.

**Related:** [[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)]], [[Admin Account]], [[Zero Trust]]
