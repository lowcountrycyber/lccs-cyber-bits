**One-liner:** Vendor management tracks third-party providers, their access, and their performance.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Managing vendors reduces surprises from outages or security gaps in outside services.

**Related:** [[Service Level Agreement (SLA)]], [[Compliance Audit]], [[Incident Response]]
