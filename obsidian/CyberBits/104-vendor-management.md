# Vendor Management

**One-liner:** Vendor management tracks third-party providers, their access, and their performance.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Managing vendors reduces surprises from outages or security gaps in outside services.

**Related:** [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](105-sla), [Compliance Audit](116-compliance-audit), [Incident Response](083-incident-response)
