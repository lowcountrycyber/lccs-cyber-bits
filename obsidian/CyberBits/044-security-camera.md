# Security Camera

**One-liner:** A security camera records video for safety and monitoring.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Cameras should be isolated so a hacked camera can't reach business systems.

**Related:** [[VLAN (Virtual LAN)]], [[Network Video Recorder (NVR)]], [[Cloud Backup]]
