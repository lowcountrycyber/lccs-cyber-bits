# VoIP Phone

**One-liner:** A VoIP phone makes calls over the internet instead of phone lines.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Proper QoS and power keep calls clear so you don't miss sales or support calls.

**Related:** [[Quality of Service (QoS)]], [[Power over Ethernet (PoE)]], [[Network Switch]]
