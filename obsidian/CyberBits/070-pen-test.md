# Penetration Test

**One-liner:** A penetration test simulates an attack to find weaknesses in your defenses.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Pen tests reveal gaps so you can fix them before criminals exploit them.

**Related:** [[Vulnerability Scan]], [[Firewall]], [[Incident Response]]
