# IPv6

**One-liner:** IPv6 is the newer addressing system with a huge pool of internet addresses.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** New services and ISPs are moving to IPv6, so your gear should handle it.

**Related:** [DHCP](024-dhcp), [Router](001-router), [IPv4](032-ipv4)
