# Internet Service Provider (ISP)

**One-liner:** An ISP is the company that sells you internet access and often provides the modem and basic support.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Knowing what your ISP is responsible for helps you decide when to call them versus fixing your own gear.

**Related:** [[Modem]], [[Router]], [[Bandwidth]]
