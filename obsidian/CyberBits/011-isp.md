# Internet Service Provider (ISP)

**One-liner:** An ISP is the company that sells you internet access and often provides the modem and basic support.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Knowing what your ISP is responsible for helps you decide when to call them versus fixing your own gear.

**Related:** [Modem](003-modem), [Router](001-router), [Bandwidth](021-bandwidth)
