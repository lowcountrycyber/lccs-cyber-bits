# Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)

**One-liner:** A UPS is a battery that keeps equipment running through short power losses.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** It prevents sudden shutdowns that corrupt servers, storage, and network gear.

**Related:** [[Server]], [[Network-Attached Storage (NAS)]], [[Network Switch]]
