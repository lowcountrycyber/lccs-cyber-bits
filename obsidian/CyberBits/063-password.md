**One-liner:** A password is the secret phrase used to prove who you are when logging in.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Weak or reused passwords are an easy way in for attackers.

**Related:** [Password Manager](007-password-manager), [MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)](006-mfa), [Password Policy](065-password-policy)
