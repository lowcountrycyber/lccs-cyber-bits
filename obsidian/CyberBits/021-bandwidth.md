# Bandwidth

**One-liner:** Bandwidth is the amount of data your connection can move at once.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Too little bandwidth means slow cloud apps and choppy calls that frustrate customers and staff.

**Related:** [[Quality of Service (QoS)]], [[Internet Service Provider (ISP)]], [[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]]
