# Bandwidth

**One-liner:** Bandwidth is the amount of data your connection can move at once.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Too little bandwidth means slow cloud apps and choppy calls that frustrate customers and staff.

**Related:** [Quality of Service (QoS)](022-qos), [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](011-isp), [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](008-vpn)
