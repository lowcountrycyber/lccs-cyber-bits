**One-liner:** An SLA is a contract that defines service expectations like uptime and response times.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Clear SLAs set accountability with ISPs and vendors when things break.

**Related:** [[Internet Service Provider (ISP)]], [[Vendor Management]], [[Uptime Monitoring]]
