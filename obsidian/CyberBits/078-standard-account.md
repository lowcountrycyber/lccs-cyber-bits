# Standard Account

**One-liner:** A standard account is an everyday user login with limited permissions.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Working in standard accounts lowers the blast radius of mistakes or malware.

**Related:** [Admin Account](077-admin-account), [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](076-role-based-access-control), [MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)](006-mfa)
