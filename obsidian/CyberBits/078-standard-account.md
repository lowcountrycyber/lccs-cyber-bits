# Standard Account

**One-liner:** A standard account is an everyday user login with limited permissions.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Working in standard accounts lowers the blast radius of mistakes or malware.

**Related:** [[Admin Account]], [[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)]], [[MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)]]
