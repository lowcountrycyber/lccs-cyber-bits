# Modem

**One-liner:** The modem is the device that speaks the language of your internet provider and brings the connection into your building.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Knowing where the modem ends and your network begins helps you see what you control versus what your ISP controls.

**Related:** [[Router]], [[Internet Service Provider (ISP)]]
