# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**One-liner:** RBAC assigns permissions based on job roles instead of individuals.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Roles keep access consistent and make onboarding and offboarding faster.

**Related:** [Least Privilege](075-least-privilege), [Standard Account](078-standard-account), [Service Account](079-service-account)
