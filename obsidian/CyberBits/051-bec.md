# Business Email Compromise (BEC)

**One-liner:** BEC is when attackers hijack or spoof business email to redirect money or data.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** A single fake invoice can quietly move thousands of dollars out of your account.

**Related:** [Phishing](014-phishing), [MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)](006-mfa), [Email Filtering](053-email-filtering)
