# Data Retention

**One-liner:** Data retention sets how long you keep different kinds of data.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Keeping data only as long as needed reduces legal risk and storage cost.

**Related:** [Data Classification](074-data-classification), [Backup](009-backup), [Compliance Audit](116-compliance-audit)
