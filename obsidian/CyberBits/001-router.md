# Router

**One-liner:** The router is the box that connects your home or office network to the internet and decides where traffic goes.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** If your router is old or poorly configured, it's often the weakest link attackers target first.

**Related:** [[Firewall]], [[Modem]], [[Guest Wi-Fi]]
