# Guest Wi-Fi

**One-liner:** Guest Wi-Fi is a separate wireless network for visitors that keeps them away from your business devices and data.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Segregating guests from your main network makes it much harder for a visitor's infected device to harm your business.

**Related:** [[Router]], [[VLAN (Virtual LAN)]], [[Zero Trust]]
