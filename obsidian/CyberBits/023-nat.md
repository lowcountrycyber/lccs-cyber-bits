# Network Address Translation (NAT)

**One-liner:** NAT lets many devices share one public internet address by rewriting traffic.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** NAT hides internal devices from the internet, reducing exposure and saving IP costs.

**Related:** [Router](001-router), [Firewall](002-firewall), [Network Ports](012-ports)
