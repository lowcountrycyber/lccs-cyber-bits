# Password Manager

**One-liner:** A password manager is a secure vault that stores and fills your passwords so you don't reuse or write them on sticky notes.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Using a password manager dramatically reduces weak passwords and makes staff onboarding/offboarding much cleaner.
