# MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

**One-liner:** MFA adds an extra step to logins, like a code on your phone, so a stolen password by itself isn't enough.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Turning on MFA for email, banking, and key business apps is the single highest-value, low-effort security upgrade.

**Related:** [Password Manager](007-password-manager), [Phishing](014-phishing)
