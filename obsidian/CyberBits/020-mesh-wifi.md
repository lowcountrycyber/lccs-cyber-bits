# Mesh Wi-Fi

**One-liner:** Mesh Wi-Fi uses multiple access points that work together to cover a whole building.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Mesh reduces dead zones so staff and devices stay connected across the office or home.

**Related:** [[Access Point]], [[Bandwidth]], [[Quality of Service (QoS)]]
