# Mesh Wi-Fi

**One-liner:** Mesh Wi-Fi uses multiple access points that work together to cover a whole building.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Mesh reduces dead zones so staff and devices stay connected across the office or home.

**Related:** [Access Point](018-access-point), [Bandwidth](021-bandwidth), [Quality of Service (QoS)](022-qos)
