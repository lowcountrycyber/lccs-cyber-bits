# Quality of Service (QoS)

**One-liner:** QoS lets you prioritize important traffic like calls over less urgent traffic.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Prioritizing voice or payment traffic prevents choppy calls and failed transactions during busy times.

**Related:** [[Bandwidth]], [[VoIP Phone]], [[Mesh Wi-Fi]]
