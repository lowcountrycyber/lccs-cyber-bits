# Quality of Service (QoS)

**One-liner:** QoS lets you prioritize important traffic like calls over less urgent traffic.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Prioritizing voice or payment traffic prevents choppy calls and failed transactions during busy times.

**Related:** [Bandwidth](021-bandwidth), [VoIP Phone](048-voip-phone), [Mesh Wi-Fi](020-mesh-wifi)
