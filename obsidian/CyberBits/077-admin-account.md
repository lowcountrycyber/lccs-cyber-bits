# Admin Account

**One-liner:** An admin account can change settings, install software, and manage other accounts.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Using admin accounts only when needed reduces accidental or malicious damage.

**Related:** [[Standard Account]], [[MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)]], [[Least Privilege]]
