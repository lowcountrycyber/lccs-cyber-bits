# RAID

**One-liner:** RAID combines multiple disks for redundancy or speed in servers and NAS devices.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** RAID keeps storage available if one disk fails, buying time to replace it.

**Related:** [Network-Attached Storage (NAS)](038-nas), [Backup](009-backup), [Server](039-server)
