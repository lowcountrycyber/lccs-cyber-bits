# Disaster Recovery

**One-liner:** Disaster recovery is the plan to restore systems and data after a major outage or attack.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** A clear recovery plan means downtime is measured in hours instead of days or weeks.

**Related:** [[Backup]], [[Business Continuity Plan]], [[Cloud Backup]]
