# Port Forwarding

**One-liner:** Port forwarding tells your router to send specific incoming traffic to a device inside your network.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Misconfigured forwarding can expose devices to the internet; use it only when necessary.

**Related:** [Network Ports](012-ports), [Network Address Translation (NAT)](023-nat), [Remote Access](030-remote-access)
