# Encryption

**One-liner:** Encryption scrambles data so only authorized people can read it.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Encrypting data in transit and at rest protects customer and financial info.

**Related:** [[SSL/TLS]], [[Disk Encryption]], [[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]]
