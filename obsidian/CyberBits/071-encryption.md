# Encryption

**One-liner:** Encryption scrambles data so only authorized people can read it.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Encrypting data in transit and at rest protects customer and financial info.

**Related:** [SSL/TLS](034-ssl-tls), [Disk Encryption](072-disk-encryption), [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](008-vpn)
