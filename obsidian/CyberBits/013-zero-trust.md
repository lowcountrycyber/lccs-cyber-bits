# Zero Trust

**One-liner:** Zero Trust means no device or user is trusted by default; every access is verified each time.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Assuming nothing is safe by default limits how far an attacker can move if they get in.

**Related:** [VLAN (Virtual LAN)](005-vlan), [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](008-vpn), [Least Privilege](075-least-privilege), [MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)](006-mfa)
