# Zero Trust

**One-liner:** Zero Trust means no device or user is trusted by default; every access is verified each time.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Assuming nothing is safe by default limits how far an attacker can move if they get in.

**Related:** [[VLAN (Virtual LAN)]], [[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]], [[Least Privilege]], [[MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)]]
