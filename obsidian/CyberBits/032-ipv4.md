# IPv4

**One-liner:** IPv4 is the older, widely used internet addressing system with limited addresses.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Most gear still relies on IPv4, so you need to support it even as IPv6 grows.

**Related:** [DHCP](024-dhcp), [Network Address Translation (NAT)](023-nat), [IPv6](033-ipv6)
