# Backup

**One-liner:** Backups are copies of your important data stored somewhere else so you can recover from mistakes, failures, or attacks.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** A tested backup can turn a ransomware attack from a business-ending event into a bad day.

**Related:** [Ransomware](010-ransomware), [Disaster Recovery](016-disaster-recovery)
