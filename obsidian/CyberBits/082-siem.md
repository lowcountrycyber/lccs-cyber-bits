# SIEM

**One-liner:** A SIEM collects and correlates logs to spot suspicious activity.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** SIEM alerts you to attacks early so you can respond before damage grows.

**Related:** [Logging](080-logging), [Incident Response](083-incident-response), [Monitoring Alerts](107-monitoring-alerts)
