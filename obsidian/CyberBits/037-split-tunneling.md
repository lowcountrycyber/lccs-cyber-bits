# Split Tunneling

**One-liner:** Split tunneling lets some traffic go through a VPN while other traffic goes direct to the internet.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** It can improve speed but must be managed so sensitive traffic still stays protected.

**Related:** [[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]], [[Bandwidth]], [[Remote Access]]
