# Split Tunneling

**One-liner:** Split tunneling lets some traffic go through a VPN while other traffic goes direct to the internet.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** It can improve speed but must be managed so sensitive traffic still stays protected.

**Related:** [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](008-vpn), [Bandwidth](021-bandwidth), [Remote Access](030-remote-access)
