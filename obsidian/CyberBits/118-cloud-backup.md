# Cloud Backup

**One-liner:** Cloud backup stores copies of your data in a secure offsite service.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Offsite backups protect you if local devices are stolen, flooded, or encrypted by ransomware.

**Related:** [[Backup]], [[Disaster Recovery]], [[Network-Attached Storage (NAS)]]
