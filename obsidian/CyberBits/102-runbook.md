# Runbook

**One-liner:** A runbook is a step-by-step guide for handling routine tasks or incidents.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Runbooks make responses repeatable so fixes are fast and consistent.

**Related:** [Incident Response](083-incident-response), [Backup](009-backup), [Documentation](101-documentation)
