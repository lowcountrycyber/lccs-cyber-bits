# Passphrase

**One-liner:** A passphrase is a longer, easier-to-remember password made of several words.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Long passphrases are stronger and harder to guess or crack.

**Related:** [Password Manager](007-password-manager), [Password Policy](065-password-policy), [MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)](006-mfa)
