# Passphrase

**One-liner:** A passphrase is a longer, easier-to-remember password made of several words.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Long passphrases are stronger and harder to guess or crack.

**Related:** [[Password Manager]], [[Password Policy]], [[MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)]]
