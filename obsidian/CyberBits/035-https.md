# HTTPS

**One-liner:** HTTPS is the secure, encrypted version of HTTP used by websites.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Using HTTPS protects customer data and avoids browser security warnings.

**Related:** [SSL/TLS](034-ssl-tls), [Browser Updates](120-browser-updates), [Digital Certificate](036-certificate)
