**One-liner:** Monitoring alerts notify you when systems are down or behaving abnormally.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Fast alerts reduce downtime and lost revenue.

**Related:** [Logging](080-logging), [Uptime Monitoring](106-uptime-monitoring), [Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)](108-rmm)
