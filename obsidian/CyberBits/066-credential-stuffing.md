# Credential Stuffing

**One-liner:** Credential stuffing is using stolen passwords from one site to break into another.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Reused passwords let attackers hop from old breaches into your business accounts.

**Related:** [Password Manager](007-password-manager), [MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)](006-mfa), [Password Policy](065-password-policy)
