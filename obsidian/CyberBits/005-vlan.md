# VLAN (Virtual LAN)

**One-liner:** A VLAN is a way to slice one physical network into multiple logical networks, each with its own rules and boundaries.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Using VLANs lets you isolate risky devices like cameras or guest Wi-Fi from sensitive systems like POS and accounting.

**Related:** [Guest Wi-Fi](004-guest-wifi), [Firewall](002-firewall), [Zero Trust](013-zero-trust)
