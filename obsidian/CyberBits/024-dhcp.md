# DHCP

**One-liner:** DHCP automatically hands out IP addresses to devices on your network.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Automatic addressing prevents conflicts that knock devices offline.

**Related:** [Router](001-router), [IP Addressing](128-ip-addressing), [Static IP](089-static-ip)
