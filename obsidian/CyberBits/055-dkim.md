# DKIM

**One-liner:** DKIM signs outgoing email so recipients can verify it wasn't altered.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Signed email builds trust and helps filters catch forgeries.

**Related:** [SPF](054-spf), [DMARC](056-dmarc), [Email Filtering](053-email-filtering)
