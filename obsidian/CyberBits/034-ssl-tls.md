# SSL/TLS

**One-liner:** SSL/TLS is the encryption that protects data in transit between browsers and services.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Without TLS, logins and payments can be stolen in transit.

**Related:** [HTTPS](035-https), [Encryption](071-encryption), [Digital Certificate](036-certificate)
