# BYOD Policy

**One-liner:** A BYOD policy defines how personal devices can be used for work.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Rules for personal devices prevent data leaks and support headaches.

**Related:** [[Remote Work Policy]], [[Mobile Device Management (MDM)]], [[Acceptable Use Policy]]
