**One-liner:** A BYOD policy defines how personal devices can be used for work.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Rules for personal devices prevent data leaks and support headaches.

**Related:** [Remote Work Policy](090-remote-work-policy), [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](092-mobile-device-management), [Acceptable Use Policy](098-acceptable-use-policy)
