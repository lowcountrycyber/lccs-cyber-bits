# IP Addressing

**One-liner:** IP addressing is the numbering system that lets devices find each other on networks.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Understanding addressing helps you troubleshoot why devices can't reach each other.

**Related:** [DHCP](024-dhcp), [IPv4](032-ipv4), [IPv6](033-ipv6)
