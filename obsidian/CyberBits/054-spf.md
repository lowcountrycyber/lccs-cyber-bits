# SPF

**One-liner:** SPF is a DNS record that lists which servers can send email for your domain.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** SPF reduces spoofed mail that can trick staff or customers.

**Related:** [DKIM](055-dkim), [DMARC](056-dmarc), [Email Filtering](053-email-filtering)
