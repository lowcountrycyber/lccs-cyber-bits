# Network Video Recorder (NVR)

**One-liner:** An NVR stores video from IP security cameras on your network.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Isolating NVRs and backing them up protects evidence and privacy.

**Related:** [[Security Camera]], [[VLAN (Virtual LAN)]], [[Cloud Backup]]
