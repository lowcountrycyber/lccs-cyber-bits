# Documentation

**One-liner:** Documentation records how systems are set up and how to operate them.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Good docs speed up troubleshooting and onboarding new staff or vendors.

**Related:** [[Change Management]], [[Runbook]], [[Incident Response]]
