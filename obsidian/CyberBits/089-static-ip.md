# Static IP

**One-liner:** A static IP is an address that does not change over time.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Static IPs make remote access and services more reliable.

**Related:** [DHCP](024-dhcp), [Port Forwarding](029-port-forwarding), [Remote Access](030-remote-access)
