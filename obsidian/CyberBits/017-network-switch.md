# Network Switch

**One-liner:** A switch connects multiple wired devices so they can talk inside your network.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** Reliable switching keeps printers, servers, and VoIP phones talking without drops.

**Related:** [[Router]], [[Ethernet]], [[VLAN (Virtual LAN)]]
