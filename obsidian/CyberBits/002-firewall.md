# Firewall

**One-liner:** A firewall is a traffic bouncer that decides which network connections are allowed in or out.

**Why it matters for small businesses / home offices:** A properly configured firewall can block most casual attacks and mistakes before they reach your devices.

**Related:** [[Router]], [[Network Ports]], [[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]]
